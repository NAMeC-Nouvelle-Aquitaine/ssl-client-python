## Algorithm description

### Blocking path determination

We only take in account the enemies which are as close or closer to the destination point than we are. 

Consider a "danger circle" around every enemy.  
Danger circle radius is to be determined in a more precise way, but should look like :  

$$r_{danger} = 2 * r_{robot} + k$$

| Parameter         | Description                       | Value                |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------|
| $r_{robot}$       | Physical radius of a robot's body | <center>TBD</center> |
| k                 | #                                 | Constant             |

The constant k should be adjusted to take in account the fact that a given robot might also run towards our new trajectory and disrupt it.
Perhaps it should vary for each enemy robot

Important point : We consider in this draft that, if a robot goes to the edge of a danger circle, it will NOT 
be considered inside this danger circle. This explains the times 2 in the formula, as we consider the radius of our robot,
and the radius of the enemy robot.

If the optimal path cuts at least one danger circle, we will define a new waypoint for the robot to go to, in order to "avoid"
the enemy. Multiple danger circles should create multiple "intermediate" waypoints to go to.

### New waypoint calculation, i.e. how to avoid the enemy
Using the optimal path computed, and the enemy's danger circle,
we need to compute a point that must follow these requirements :
* be a bit closer to the destination point than the enemy
* be on the edge of the danger circle

For simplicity's sake, we will only try in this draft to compute a point on the edge of the circle.  
Here is a drawing to make you understand my idea

![Optimal path being blocked](optimal_path_in_danger_circle.png)
*Figure 1 : Optimal path is being blocked because it crosses a danger circle*

![New optimal path computed](optimal_path_corrected.png)
*Figure 2 : A new optimal path is computed, with an intermediate waypoint*  

Understand the fact that since we compute a linear trajectory, we won't take into account the fact that the new
intermediate point I<sub>1</sub> makes us cross the danger circle. This is just a first version that expects 
that the danger circle is big enough to make the assumption that crossing it isn't too dangerous.  

Once the robot attains the intermediate point I<sub>1</sub>, the enemy robot in the drawing will not be taken into account
because the blue robot will already be closer to point B.

### Determining intersection between a line and a circle
#### > Line equation used
Fairly simple but seems to work, we only require 2 points that are on the line, and we represent
it under this representation : $y = m*x + p$


m can be easily computed with the following formula

$$m = \frac{y_{b}-y_{a}}{x_{b}-x_{a}}$$

and p using one of the two points that belongs on the line :

$$y_a - m*x_a = p$$

#### > Circle equation used
The current algorithm uses the standard equation form of a circle :

$$(x - k)^2 + (y - h)^2 - r^2$$

where (k, h) are the coordinates of the circle's center, and r is its radius.

#### Solving the equation equality
We use the `scipy.optimize.fsolve` function to solve the following system of equations :  
$$m*x + p - y = 0$$  
$$(x - k)^2 + (y - h)^2 - r^2 = 0$$

The usage of this function isn't quite trivial, I recommend checking out [SciPy's docs](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.fsolve.html)

Becaue of the `full_output` flag set to `True`, we can retrieve the integer telling us whether roots have been found or not. This is how we manage to find the roots. 

## ! Other points to consider !
Enemy robot radius same as ours ?  
k as a variable and not a constant in the danger circle formula ?  
Make better drawings, which don't have flashbang-white backgrounds
